I'm *Morteza* (he/him), a researcher at the University of Luxembourg. I specialize in computational neuroscience and computer engineering, and enjoy working on projects that have an impact on aligning AI to human cognition (or the other way around). I received my PhD in Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences from Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany) and University of Luxembourg (Belval, Luxembourg) in January 2023. My thesis, *"Towards a Computational Model of General Cognitive Control Using Artificial Intelligence, Experimental Psychology, and Cognitive Neuroscience"*, emphesizes a computationally grounded perspective on cognitive control in the human brain ([pdf](https://hdl.handle.net/10993/54481) Â· [repo](https://github.com/morteza/thesis) Â· [a short video of my speech at some thesis award ceremony, starting at 53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6zIn1HjJfk&t=3180s)).
